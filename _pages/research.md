## Symbolic Regression & Scientific Discovery

### Constrained Symbolic Regression for Financial Return Prediction
**Columbia University** | Oct 2025 – Present  
*Advisors: Prof. Tian Zheng, Dr. Kara Lamb, Dr. Mikhail Smirnov*

Developed a Constrained Symbolic Regression (CSR) framework for equity premium prediction. Key innovations include task-aware wavelet denoising, stability selection via bootstrap resampling, and soft constraints with interval estimation to handle low signal-to-noise environments. Validated across equity returns, Treasury yields, and volatility forecasting.

### Cloud Microphysics Emulation: Next-Generation Symbolic Regression
**LEAP Center, Columbia University** | Aug 2025 – Present  
*Advisor: Dr. Kara Lamb, Prof. Tian Zheng*

Designed a three-stage symbolic regression framework integrating E-WSINDy, LaSR, and AI Feynman, achieving 50-1000x noise robustness improvement. Applied Hessian-based decomposition and Buckingham π theorem for dimensional analysis. Developed bootstrap ensemble methods for uncertainty quantification with physics-informed constraints.

## Machine Learning & Computer Vision

### Weakly Supervised Tree Species Classification
**TZstats Convergence Lab, Columbia University** | Sep 2025 – Present  
*Advisor: Prof. Tian Zheng*

Migrated APL pipeline from TensorFlow to PyTorch with GPU acceleration. Proposed algorithmic improvements including graph-based clustering (kNN + Leiden, HDBSCAN) and sigmoid-weighted loss functions for robustness under noisy annotations.

## Computational Biology & Clinical Research

### Treatment Discontinuation Modeling in CATIE Antipsychotic Trial
**Zuckerman Institute, Columbia University** | May 2025 – Present  
*Advisor: Prof. Kiyohito Iigaya*

Established reproducible pipelines for CATIE clinical data (1,400+ schizophrenia patients). Applied PCA and factor analysis to identify latent symptom dimensions predicting treatment discontinuation. *Manuscript in preparation.*

### ALFIE and VVIQ Mental Imagery Profile Analysis
**The Living Lab, Columbia University** | Jan 2025 – Present  
*Advisor: Dr. Alfredo Spagna*

Employed ensemble clustering and co-clustering consensus to identify three robust imagery phenotypes from 100 participants. *Manuscript in preparation.*

## Previous Research

### Photometric Analysis of Supernova AT2023hpb
**UCSB Experimental Cosmology Group** | Mar 2023 – Jun 2023  
*Advisor: Prof. Phillip Lubin*

Conducted observation using Las Cumbres Observatory; analyzed light curves to infer Type II classification.

### Panel Regression of Macroeconomic Indicators on U.S. Stock Returns
**UC Santa Barbara** | Jun 2022 – Mar 2023  
*Advisor: Prof. Saad Mouti*

Applied robust and panel regression models to evaluate predictive significance of macroeconomic variables on equity returns.
