## Symbolic Regression & Scientific Discovery

### Physics-Informed Symbolic Regression Framework
**LEAP Center, Columbia University** | Aug 2025 – Present  
*Advisors: Prof. Tian Zheng, Dr. Kara Lamb*

Developing a physics-informed symbolic regression framework for discovering interpretable equations from noisy, high-dimensional data. The core idea is PySR-guided E-WSINDy: using PySR's genetic programming to discover equation structures, then using E-WSINDy's weak-form sparse regression to refine coefficients with rigorous uncertainty quantification. The weak-form integral formulation provides noise robustness by transferring derivatives from noisy data to smooth test functions.

The framework implements: (1) Buckingham Pi dimensional analysis and power-law symmetry detection for physics-guided feature engineering; (2) a 5-layer augmented feature library with dual-track model selection (PySR + E-WSINDy); and (3) three-layer uncertainty quantification covering structural, parametric, and predictive uncertainty. Currently applying to warm rain microphysics—discovering interpretable parameterizations for autoconversion and accretion processes from LES simulation data.

### Constrained Symbolic Regression for Financial Return Prediction
**Columbia University** | Oct 2025 – Present  
*Advisors: Prof. Tian Zheng, Dr. Kara Lamb, Dr. Mikhail Smirnov*

Developed a Constrained Symbolic Regression (CSR) framework for equity premium prediction. Key innovations include task-aware wavelet denoising, stability selection via bootstrap resampling, and soft constraints with interval estimation to handle low signal-to-noise environments. Validated across equity returns, Treasury yields, and volatility forecasting.

### Weakly Supervised Tree Species Classification
**TZstats Convergence Lab, Columbia University** | Sep 2025 – Present  
*Advisor: Prof. Tian Zheng*

Migrated APL pipeline from TensorFlow to PyTorch with GPU acceleration. Proposed algorithmic improvements including graph-based clustering (kNN + Leiden, HDBSCAN) and sigmoid-weighted loss functions for robustness under noisy annotations.
