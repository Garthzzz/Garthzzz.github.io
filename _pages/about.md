I am a Statistics M.A. student (Machine Learning track) at **Columbia University**, maintaining a 3.9 GPA while contributing to multiple research projects across climate science, computational biology, and quantitative finance. I hold dual B.S. degrees in Mathematics and Physics from UC Santa Barbara.

## Research Focus

My research centers on developing **physics-informed symbolic regression** algorithms that discover interpretable equations from noisy, high-dimensional data. At Columbia's [LEAP Center](https://leap.columbia.edu/), I work with Dr. Kara Lamb on next-generation methods for scientific discovery—designing frameworks that achieve 50-1000x noise robustness improvement over traditional approaches.

What excites me most is the **cross-domain generalizability** of these methods. The same algorithmic innovations that help us understand cloud microphysics can be adapted—with appropriate modifications for low signal-to-noise environments—to predict financial returns or model clinical outcomes. We have made progress applying this framework to finance: given the extremely low SNR characteristic of financial data, we incorporated task-aware wavelet denoising and replaced point estimates with interval-valued coefficients to honestly reflect uncertainty. See our [Financial Symbolic Regression project](https://github.com/Garthzzz/Financial-Symbolic-Regression-with-Uncertainty-Quantification) for more details.

Beyond symbolic regression, I also contribute to several other research projects at Columbia: weakly supervised learning for remote sensing imagery (Prof. Tian Zheng), treatment discontinuation modeling in the CATIE antipsychotic trial (Prof. Kiyohito Iigaya, Zuckerman Institute), and mental imagery phenotype analysis (Dr. Alfredo Spagna).

## Research Interests

- **Applied Focus**: I am drawn to research that bridges methodological innovation with real-world impact—developing algorithms that not only advance theory but solve practical problems
- **Symbolic Regression & Equation Discovery**: Noise-robust algorithms (E-WSINDy, constrained SR), uncertainty quantification, physics-informed constraints
- **Machine Learning**: Weakly supervised learning, dimensionality reduction, clustering, factor analysis
- **Applications**: Climate science, quantitative finance, computational biology, clinical trials

## Beyond Academics

Outside of research, I'm a sports enthusiast—I love soccer, basketball, hiking, and cycling.

In soccer, I served as **Captain of CCST Future** during the Spring 2025 season—a team under the Columbia Chinese Student Soccer Team designed for beginners and hobbyists. I create space for newcomers to find their footing in a new city, organizing training for players of varying skill levels and fostering an environment where competition coexists with mutual support. I am also a **committee member and player for CCST's competitive main squad**, where I coordinated logistics off the field and competed on it—winning the **Penn Cup Championship** together in March 2025.

I'm also an NBA fan and a devoted **Memphis Grizzlies** supporter. Dissatisfied with existing advanced metrics, I developed my own player impact model in 2025: the [Bayesian Enhanced Baseline-and-Residual Model (BEBRM)](https://github.com/Garthzzz/nba-BEBRM). Unlike traditional metrics that rely heavily on box-score statistics or pure on/off differentials, BEBRM integrates non-traditional data sources (defensive matchup outcomes, hustle stats, Synergy play-type efficiencies) into a Bayesian prior baseline, then applies iterative possession-level residual corrections. The model provides explicit uncertainty quantification through credible intervals—particularly valuable for evaluating players with limited sample sizes.

## What's Next

I am applying to **Data Science PhD programs** and **Financial Engineering master's programs** for Fall 2026, seeking to continue developing interpretable machine learning methods with real-world impact.
