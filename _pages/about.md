I am a Statistics M.A. student (Machine Learning track) at Columbia University. I hold dual B.S. degrees in Mathematics and B.A. degrees in Physics from UC Santa Barbara.

My research focuses on developing **physics-informed machine learning** methods, particularly symbolic regression algorithms that discover interpretable equations from noisy data. At Columbia's [LEAP Center](https://leap.columbia.edu/), I work with Dr. Kara Lamb on next-generation symbolic regression for climate science and financial applications.

## Research Interests

- **Symbolic Regression & Scientific Discovery**: Designing noise-robust algorithms (E-WSINDy, constrained SR) for equation discovery
- **Machine Learning**: Weakly supervised learning, dimensionality reduction, clustering methods
- **Applications**: Climate science, quantitative finance, computational biology, clinical trials
